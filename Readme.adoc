== OSGi Bundles for Akka

With https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28304[Issue 28304] the akka team has announced that the OSGi support for
Akka shall be moved out of the main project as per Akka 2.6.2.

As of today, https://akka.io/[Akka 2.6.6] is still released with OSGi Headers in most of it's bundles, but the goal
of removing the OSGi support is still https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28304#issuecomment-620022900[valid].

This project aims to provide jars based on the original jars provided by Akka with proper Manifests so that Akka
can be used within OSGi. Our own https://github.com/woq-blended/blended[project] heavily relies on Akka, Akka Stream
and Akka Http, so that we need those bundles for ourselves.

=== Approach

We will consume the jars for a given Akka version and run them through our build process to provide the OSGi manifest.
For each jar we run a quick sanity check to make sure that our bundling process didn't lose any content of the
original jar.

We start out the process with a limited set of Akka jars required by our own project. Over time we may add more
bundles, perhaps with some help from the community.

Later in the process we hope to add more tests to verify that the bundles are working as expected. For now we are
using the test we have in our main project to validate that our bundles are working.

=== Build from source

We use https://github.com/lihaoyi/mill[Mill build tool] to build the bundles.

After cloning the repository, simply navigate to the checkout directory and use the bundled mill
script `./millw`, which is a copy of https://github.com/lefou/millw[lefou/millw].

=== Selected build targets / commands

|===
| mill command | Description

| `mill __.publishLocal`
| Build and publish all publishable artifacts into a local ivy2 repository.

| `mill __.publishM2Local`
| Build and publish all publishable artifacts into a local Maven2 repository.

| `mill -j 0 -k __.testCached`
| Run all unit test in parallel and keep mill going even a test failure occured
|===

=== IDE support

We use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] in our project.
You can generate IntelliJ IDEA project files with mill with the following commandline:

----
mill mill.scalalib.GenIdea/idea
----

== Download  artifacts from Maven Central

At the moment we not released any bundles. Once we have a stable set of bundles that can be used,
they will be available via http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22de.wayofquality.blended%22[Maven Central].
